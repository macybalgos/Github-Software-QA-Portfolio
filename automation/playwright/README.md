<h2><b> Playwright Automation Overview </b> </h2>

This section highlights my automation testing work using **Playwright**.  
It includes test scripts, project structure, and best practices I follow for scalable and maintainable automation.  
Youâ€™ll find examples of **test cases**, **page object models**, **reporting (Allure)**, and **CI/CD integration** that demonstrate my real-world QA automation approach.
