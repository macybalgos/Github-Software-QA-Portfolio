## Disclaimer

‚ö†Ô∏è I use these generated test cases as a **basis or starting point**.  
They are **automatically created by AI** and should be **reviewed and refined** before considering them as final test cases.  
These are **not the only possible scenarios** ‚Äî testers must **think out of the box** to cover additional cases.
